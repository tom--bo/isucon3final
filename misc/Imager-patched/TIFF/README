Imager::File::TIFF provides TIFF file format support for Imager.

It requires libtiff to be installed, including development files.

For Linux distributions this typically requires installation of the
associated -dev or -devel package.

See Imager::Install for more information.

This is currently shipped as part of Imager, but Imager may install
with out installing Imager::File::TIFF, so if you need TIFF support,
add a dependency on Imager::File::TIFF.

Makefile.PL will reject libtiff 3.9.0 due to a bug in that release.
