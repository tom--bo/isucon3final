Imager::Font::T1 provides Type 1 font support for Imager via T1Lib.

  http://imager.perl.org/
  http://www.t1lib.org/

This requires that t1lib is installed, including any development files.

For Linux distributions this typically requires installation of the
associated -dev or -devel package.

See Imager::Install for more information.

Imager::Font::T1 is shipped as part of Imager, but if the libraries
required aren't found it won't be installed.  If you require T1
support via libt1 then add a dependency on Imager::Font::T1.

Imager::Font::FT2 provides most of the functionality of
Imager::Font::T1 and more.
