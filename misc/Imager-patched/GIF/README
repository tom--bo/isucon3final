Imager::File::GIF provides GIF file format support for Imager.

It requires libgif to be installed, including development headers.

For Linux distributions this typically requires installation of the
associated -dev or -devel package.

See Imager::Install for more information.

Imager::File::GIF is currently shipped as part of Imager, but Imager
may install with out installing Imager::File::GIF, so if you need GIF
support, add a dependency on Imager::File::GIF.

Makefile.PL will reject libgif 4.2.0 and 5.0.0 due to bugs in those
releases.
