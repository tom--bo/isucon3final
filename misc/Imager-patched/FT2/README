Imager::Font::FT2 provides font support to Imager via the FreeType 2
library.

It requires libfreetype and its development header files to be
installed.

For Linux distributions this typically requires installation of the
associated -dev or -devel package.

See Imager::Install for more information.

Imager::Font::FT2 is currently shipped as part of Imager, but but
Imager may install with out installing Imager::Font::FT2.  If your
module or application requires FreeType 2 support then add
Imager::Font::FT2 as a prerequisite.
