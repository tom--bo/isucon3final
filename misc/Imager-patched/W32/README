Imager::Font::W32 provides font support to Imager via the Win32 GDI
API functions..

It requires Win32 header files and libraries to be available.

This is currently shipped as part of Imager, but may not be installed
as part of Imager if headers or libraries aren't found at build time.,
if your module or application requires Win32 font support support then
add Imager::Font::W32 as a prerequisite.
