Imager::File::PNG provides PNG file format support for Imager.

It requires libpng, including development files, to be installed.

libpng 1.2 or later is supported, with minor extra features with
libpng 1.4 and libpng 1.5.3.

For Linux distributions this typically requires installation of the
associated -dev or -devel package.

See Imager::Install for more information.

Imager::File::PNG is currently shipped as part of Imager, but Imager
may install without installing Imager::File::PNG, so if you need PNG
support, add a dependency on Imager::File::PNG.
